USE CASE PERSONAL DETAILS EDITOR

-) Within single page (without navigating to different page) offer editing functionality for editing personal details
-) The same models as in "UseCase1_display_details" are used
-) Model references do not have to be the same, however all details encapsulated by the models must be editable via this UI
-) A save button will need to be visible. Instead of sending the data to a server, instead a popup is opened to display the values currently saved in the underlying model
